# Task E4. Homework with object JavaScript. First steps
Task 1. Write a function that takes an object as an argument and outputs to the console all the keys and values of its own properties only.
This function should not return a value.\
Task 2. Write a function that takes a string and an object as arguments,
and then checks whether the passed object has a property with the given name.
The function must return true or false\
Task 3. Write a function that creates an empty object, but without a prototype.
(This way of creating an object has its advantages, for example, you can be sure
that in such an object there will be only those properties that we put there.
You can safely iterate on such an object\
Task 4. Implement the following console application like the example that dealt with the video. Implement it on prototypes.
Define the hierarchy of electrical appliances. Plug some into an outlet. Calculate the power consumption.
There should be at least two such devices (for example, a desk lamp and a computer).
When choosing a device, think about what properties it has.\
Task 5. Rewrite a console application from a large unit into classes.
